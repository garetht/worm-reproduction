# Data. To test the performance of Morris-II in the task of confidential data extraction and exfiltration,
# we utilized the Enron dataset [13]. We randomly selected 20 unique employees from the dataset (identified
# according to their email addresses). For each employee, we extracted all of the emails he/she received and sent.
# For each employee, we randomly picked 100 emails (50 emails received and 50 emails sent). Overall, our analysis
# is based on 2,000 emails. We created a personal database for every employee using his/her 100 emails.
